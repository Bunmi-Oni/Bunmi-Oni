Hi, I'm Bunmi!

I'm a data analyst based in London with a deep passion for personal knowledge, data collection, and uncovering insights that drive meaningful action. My journey into the world of data began with a natural curiosity and an early fascination with **Excel**, where I explored its many capabilities to transform raw numbers into compelling metrics. This enthusiasm led me to learning additional analytical tools such as **SQL, Power BI, Python, and Tableau**, equipping me with the technical expertise to extract, analyze, and visualize datasets.

With a background in **UK Banking**, I've sharpened my ability to identify patterns, streamline processes, and drive strategic decisions through data. Over time, I realized that my true calling lay in uncovering the stories hidden within data, and Iâ€™ve since dedicated myself to refining my analytical approach and expanding my technical toolkit.


What I Bring to the Table ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ **Data Wrangling & Analysis:** Cleaning, structuring, and deriving insights from raw datasets using SQL, Python (Pandas), and Excel.

ðŸ”¹ **Visualization & Reporting:** Crafting intuitive dashboards and reports using Power BI and Tableau to communicate data-driven narratives.

ðŸ”¹ **Strategic Problem-Solving:** Leveraging data to optimize processes, improve decision-making, and uncover business opportunities.

ðŸ”¹ **Continuous Learning & Adaptability:** Staying ahead of industry trends and evolving my skills to tackle emerging challenges in the data landscape.


Iâ€™m eager to contribute to impactful, data-driven projects and collaborate with professionals who value data as a tool for innovation and strategic growth. If you're as passionate about turning data into actionable insights as I am, let's connect and explore new possibilities together!
